1. First Idea,
Animal Simulator. Spawns creatures which get programmed to adept to its environment e.g. Food,
predators and Species. I plan to use GDScript / C# script in order to model the behaviour and environment.
The creatures will need to survive their environment. This will also be model with GDScript / C# script.
